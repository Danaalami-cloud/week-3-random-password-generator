# week-3-random-password-generate
For this assignmnet, I was required to generate a random passowrd.
In java script, I added varaibles for passowrd such as the minimum length, maximum length, number and special cases. 

Once the user clicks on the generate passowrd  button, a pop up appears where they are need to answer how long they need the passowrd to be, between 8 and 128 character, if they want uppercase or/and lower case in it, number or special cases. If they use all the right criteria, the a password in generated. However, if they choose a number less than 8 and more than 128, then a promt will appear at the top of the page where they need to try again and follow the guidlines.
